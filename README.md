# Ashs PDF Manipulator

## Because sometimes you just want to bully a PDF into submission.

### This Scrappy little fellow lets you make PDFs your bitch without paying Adobe £29.99 a month for the privilege of… clicking a button.

Built with PyQt5, pypdf, and the kind of dark-blue colour palette that whispers “Yeah.......yeah I'm OG.”

## What This Spicy Little Program Does
### Merge PDFs

- Pick up to six PDFs

- Watch them fuse together like drunken Transformers

- **Give the resulting monstrosity a browser tab name so Chrome stops calling it final_final_rev3_REAL.pdf**

- Click MERGE

- Boom. New PDF. You are now the god of documents.

### Split PDFs 

- Load a PDF

- Choose a page to slice at

**The app creates:**

- First PDF: pages 1 → split-1

- Second PDF: pages split → end

- Name them something sensible… or something petty, depending on mood

- Optional: give each child-PDF its own browser tab name (identity is important)

- Save them wherever your desktop chaos pile lives

## Requirements

**Install these or perish:**

pip install PyQt5 pypdf


### That’s it.
#### No arcane rituals, no Java, no 17GB of Adobe updates.

It’s organised.
Unlike your Downloads folder.

How to Run This Thing

From the project folder:

python main.py


A window will appear.
If it doesn’t, sacrifice a USB cable to the computing gods and try again.

Highlights (aka “Why this app slaps”)

✔ Merge 6 PDFs like you’re assembling IKEA documents

✔ Slice PDFs cleanly like a Gordon Ramsay tantrum

✔ Custom browser tab titles, because vibes matter

✔ No subscriptions, no DRM, no Adobe snitching on you

✔ Your signature glowing dark theme (cyberpunk but also professional chaos)

✔ Works locally, offline, and without phoning home to Satan

Why This Exists

Because Adobe thinks clicking one button should cost as much as a gym membership.

Because you deal with PDFs daily and deserve a tool that doesn’t scream at you.

Because you could build this yourself… but why bother when you can bully an AI into doing it for you?

Future Features (maybe)

Extract specific pages

Rotate pages like a possessed ceiling fan

Auto-rename PDFs based on pure spite

A button that simply says “F**K THIS PDF” and outputs a JPEG instead

A feature that screams when someone uploads a Word document saved as a PDF

License

Use it, abuse it, redistribute it, tattoo it on your cat — whatever.
If it breaks, you get to keep both halves.
